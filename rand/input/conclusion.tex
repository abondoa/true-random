\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
An RNG called Parallel Memory Writer is created and presented in this paper.
It requires no extra hardware devices, no Internet connectivity and yet it provides unpredictability of the numbers generated.
It accomplishes this by utilizing several physical execution cores which are found in most modern processors.
Although slower than PNRGs it is several orders of magnitude faster than another, common RNG.

As this paper presents work toward random number generation there are without a doubt several interesting direction which research might expand.
I here present those which I believe are the most essential.
Future work on PMW is to test it with a test battery for random number generators such as \emph{Dieharder}~\citep{dieharder}.
The results could then be compared with those of common PRNGs such as the Mersenne Twister.
Another interesting research direction could be to combine PMW with a seeded PRNG such that a random seed is generated by PMW and used to produce random numbers much faster through the PNRG, which might be reseeded periodically.
