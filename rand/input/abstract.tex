In this paper research is conducted toward a much faster random number generator which can run on commodity hardware without need for extra devices.
The random number generator, Parallel Memory Writer, presented here uses several physical execution units to generate random numbers.
A performance test is conducted and used as comparison with both a random number generator and a pseudo-random number generator, showing a significant improvement over the other RNG.
