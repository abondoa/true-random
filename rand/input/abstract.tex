In this paper research is conducted toward a much faster random number generator which can run on commodity hardware without need for extra devices.
Random number generators often have to collect entropy from several different source, this either takes time or require special devices which are not present in commodity hardware.
This entropy is necessary if the numbers are to be unpredictable by a third party.
The random number generator, Parallel Memory Writer, presented here uses several physical execution units to generate random numbers.
A performance test is conducted and used as comparison with both a random number generator and a pseudo-random number generator, showing a significant improvement over the other random number generators.
The improvement in terms of throughput is orders of magnitude better.
